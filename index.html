            <p>In 2020 I was in New York city. It was really a bad year because of Covid-19 situation. I saw a lot of
                people to die after attacked by corona virus. People who always stayed in AC room are mostly attacked
                and city people always use AC.</p>

            <h3>Experience in village.</h3>
            <p>people think, in village people work very hard that's why Covid-19 couldn't affect much villagers. It is
                true that Covid attaked mostly in cities but there a lots of rumours in all over the world.</p>
